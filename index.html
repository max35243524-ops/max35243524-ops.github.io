          <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">The video on the left shows a UI that I was developing to interface with an electrical meter testing fixture. I had to work with an Arduino that translated commands from the UI into SCPI commands, 
            which were then sent to the voltage and current sources stacked below the meters. The UI was originally written in C, and I was tasked with translating it into Python. The video on the right features a current transformer board 
            that I helped design, and for which I solely wrote the code to control the ballast resistors. This allowed variable control of the output current when the board was attached to the three CTs, reaching a maximum of 600 amps.
